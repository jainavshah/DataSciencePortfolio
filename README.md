I wanted to investigate if there was a correlation between weather and energy use, therefore I collected meteorological and energy data for CT for a period of one week at the end of March 2023.

* obtain energy data and convert it on an hourly basis to draw insights for a week's worth of temperatures
* download weather information for several air stations in Connecticut
1. prepare the weather data so that you may concentrate on just a few columns
2. eliminate the missing value
3. change to numerical columns
4. date-time indexed.
5. Resample data gathered at 5-minute intervals to 60-minute intervals.
* compare the temperature trends across 2 or more stations to see if they are similar or different for the past week.
* Combine weather and energy data and use a scatter plot to examine their relationships.
